The Title Screen serves as the entry point to the game. Users are greeted with a visually appealing background image and are encouraged to click anywhere on the screen to start the game. To enhance the user experience, a rotation message is displayed on mobile devices in portrait mode, guiding users to rotate their devices for optimal gameplay.

### Game Screen

Once the user clicks to start the game, they are taken to the Game Screen. Here, they are presented with dynamic background images and a clickable button at the bottom. The game incorporates audio elements such as background music, button clicks, and other sound effects to create an immersive experience.
